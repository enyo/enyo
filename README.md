### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Franco-Austrian developer mostly focused on Frontend.

The main technologies I have used in the past decade are:

- Dart & Typescript
- Svelte & SvelteKit
- React
- Flutter
- Kubernetes
- MongoDB

I'm the maintainer of the highly successful drag'n'drop JavaScript library dropzone, and have recently launched startup that offers form endpoints under the name of Dropzone as well.
