### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Franco-Austrian developer mostly focused on Frontend.

The main technologies I have used in the past decade are:

- `Typescript`, `JavaScript`
- `CSS`, `HTML`
- `Svelte`, `SvelteKit`
- `React`, `Vue`, `Nuxt`
- `Dart`, `Flutter`
- `Kubernetes`
- `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`

### My current views ðŸ¤“

I like to use simple solutions (like serverless functions with SvelteKit) instead of overengineered perfections (micro services managed with Kubernetes and Helm).

I'm really excited to see where [wasm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) will take us, especially server side wasm.

To me, one of the most exciting changes to web development are all the new CSS features.

### Dropzone ðŸŽ¯

I'm the maintainer of the highly successful drag'n'drop JavaScript library **Dropzone** although I am not finding much time to maintain it nowadays. I'd like to add proper TypeScript types, and simplify the whole codebase if I find the time (there is lots of legacy IE6 fallback code in there).

### Pausly ðŸ§˜

I have recently launched the startup [Pausly](https://www.pausly.app/) which lets you take short 5min breaks to stretch and move while socializing with others.

### Music ðŸŽ¤

Apart from programming I am a musician. You can listen to my latest single here: https://www.yesmeno.com
