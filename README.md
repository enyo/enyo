### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Franco-Austrian developer mostly focused on Frontend.

The main technologies I have used in the past decade are:

`Typescript` & `Dart`, `Svelte` & `SvelteKit`, `React`, `Vue` & `Nuxt`, `Flutter`, `Kubernetes`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`

I'm the maintainer of the highly successful drag'n'drop JavaScript library dropzone although I am not finding much time to maintain it nowadays. I'd like to add proper TypeScript types, and simplify the whole codebase if I find the time (there is lots of legacy IE6 fallback code in there).

I have recently launched the startup [Pausly](https://www.pausly.app/) which lets you take short 5min breaks to stretch and move while socializing with others.
