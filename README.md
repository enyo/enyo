### Hi 👋

I'm a Franco-Austrian developer mostly focused on Frontend.

The main technologies I have used in the past decade are:

- `Typescript`, `JavaScript`
- `CSS`, `HTML`
- `Svelte`, `SvelteKit`
- `React`, `Vue`, `Nuxt`
- `Dart`, `Flutter`
- `Kubernetes`
- `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`

### My current views &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🤓 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 💭 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🙊

I wouldn't start a project in a programming language without types anymore (if JavaScript, then I [use JSDoc to add TypeScript types](https://www.pausly.app/blog/full-type-support-with-plain-javascript)), use Svelte and SvelteKit when possible, strongly prefer plain CSS over Tailwind (mostly because I like writing CSS and use it's new features) and think that PostgreSQL is a solid database choice although it's not very exciting.

I like to use simple solutions (like serverless functions with SvelteKit) instead of overengineered perfections (micro services managed with Kubernetes and Helm).

I'm really excited to see where [wasm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) will take us, especially server side wasm.

To me, one of the most exciting changes to web development are all the new CSS features.

I'm the maintainer of the highly successful drag'n'drop JavaScript library **Dropzone** although I am not finding much time to maintain it nowadays. I'd like to add proper TypeScript types, and simplify the whole codebase if I find the time (there is lots of legacy IE6 fallback code in there).

I have recently launched the startup [Pausly](https://www.pausly.app/) which lets you take short 5min breaks to stretch and move while socializing with others.
